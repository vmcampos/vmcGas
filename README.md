Simple JavaScript/jQuery project to capture fuel fill up info, and save to a PouchDB database (for persistence), then retrieve averages and the like.

As of 2015-12-11, Deleting a Fill Up works; deleting the whole Database works; GPS works better, too. 
As of 2015-11-14, Editing a Fill Up seems to work. Yay!
As of 2015-09-25, all input seems to work. 
As of 2014-12-10, a user can input data, then calculate their averages.

To-do: Set up checks for "good data" input by user (for example, if a person forgets the period in Gallons).  Add jQuery Mobile!
