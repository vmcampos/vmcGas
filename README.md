Simple JavaScript/jQuery project to capture fuel fill up info, and save to a PouchDB database (for persistence), then retrieve averages and the like.

As of 2015-09-25, all input seems to work. Currently working on Edit Fill Up feature (not working).
As of 2014-12-10, a user can input data, then calculate their averages.

To-do: The ability to edit (or delete) previous entries. Set up checks for "good data" input by user (for example, if a person forgets the period in Gallons).
